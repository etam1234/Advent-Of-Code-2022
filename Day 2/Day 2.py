#Advent Of Code 2022 - Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors


#1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won)

#A and X -> rock 
#B and Y -> paper
#C and Z -> scissor

#A X --> both rock, a draw (1+3 = 4)
#A Y --> rock loses to paper, a win (2+6 = 8)
#A Z --> rock wins to scissor, a loss (3+0 = 3)

#B X --> paper beats rock, a loss (1+0 = 1)
#B Y --> both paper, a draw (2+3 = 5)
#B Z --> paper loses to scissor, a win (3+6 = 9)

#C X --> scissor loses to rock, a win (1+6 = 7)
#C Y --> scissor beats paper, a loss (2+0 = 2)
#C Z --> scissor draws with scissor, a draw (3+3 = 6)
